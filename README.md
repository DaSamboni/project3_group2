## Background
In this project, the objective was to observe and analyze the patterns and driving trends of different regions within the US. For instance, trends such as which areas are safer to drive based on a variety of factors like frequency of accidents, time of day, car make, and etc.



## Technologies Used
* SQL
* PostgreSQL
* CSV file 
* Python 
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Git Hub
* Seaborn


## Limitations/Ethical Considerations
* Only used data from 2019.
* Didnâ€™t investigate every detail regarding all the accidents
   Ex: Weather, actions before accident, # of people/vehicles involved, and etc.
* Not all accidents were reported, and some were reported with incomplete information.
* Differences in population and population density per region.


## Data source
* Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonbown/us-2020-traffic-accidents?resource=download&select=acc_19.csv)
